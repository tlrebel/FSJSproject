# University of Coders Punch In/Out
### Tricia Lynette Roberts -- Full Stack JavaScript Project

The purpose of this program is to record the user numbers used as well as the time the buttons are being pressed to help track the hours. This is to help me grasp the concept of how backend works. I had hoped to give this to Code of Louisville program to use if they desired instead of the paper sign in/out. You can see where I got the inspiration from. 

This is built using the MEAN stack and CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. 

To run this code, you will need:

1. Install (https://github.com/tlrebel/FSJSproject.git) to your device.
2. Install MongoDB, NodeJS, NPM--> If not have those already on your device.
3. In the console window such as gitbash, type **npm start** and enter
4.

Go to port 3000 or localhost:3000

in the gitbash, enter npm start.
