# Code of Louisville Punch In/Out

The purpose of this program is to record the user numbers used as well as the time the buttons are being pressed to help track the hours. This is to help me grasp the concept of how backend works. I had hoped to give this to Code of Louisville program to use if they desired instead of paper sign in. You can see where I got inspired from. 

To run this code, you will need:

1. Install (https://github.com/tlrebel/FSJSproject.git) to your device.
2. 

Go to port 3000 or localhost:3000

in the gitbash, enter npm start.
